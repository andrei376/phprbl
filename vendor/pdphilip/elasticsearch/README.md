Laravel x Elasticsearch
=======================

This package extends Laravel's Eloquent model and query builder for Elasticsearch. The goal of this package is to use
Elasticsearch in laravel as if it were native to Laravel, meaning:

- Work with your [Eloquent](#eloquent) models the way you're used to, including:

    - Standard query building: `Model::where('status','>',3)->orderByDesc('created_at')->get()`
    - Model [Relationships](#relationships) (Including cross-database)
    - [Mutators & Casting](#mutators--casting)
    - Data returned as Collections
    - [Soft Deletes](#soft-deletes)
    - [Aggregations](#aggregation)
    - [Migrations](#schema/index)
    - ES features like [Geo Filtering](#geo) & [Regular Expressions](#regex-in-where)

- No need to write your own DSL queries ([unless you want to](#raw-dsl)!)
- [Eloquent style searching](#elasticsearching)

> # Alpha release notice
> This package is being released prematurely to an interested community of testers. It is not ready for production just yet only due to a lack of testing mileage. Once deemed stable, the plugin will move to V1. Elasticsearch is a deep topic on its own and there are many native features that have not yet been included. I built this because I needed it but this plugin is for everyone; submit issues (there's no way I could have found all the edge cases on my own) and feel free to submit pull requests.

Installation
===============

#### (Current Alphas)

Install the package via Composer:

Laravel 8:

```bash
$ composer require pdphilip/elasticsearch
```

Laravel 7:

```bash
$ composer require pdphilip/elasticsearch:~0.7
```

Laravel 6 (and 5.8):

```bash
$ composer require pdphilip/elasticsearch:~0.6
```

Configuration
===============

Proposed .env settings:

```dotenv
ES_AUTH_TYPE=http
ES_HOSTS="http://localhost:9200"
ES_USERNAME=
ES_PASSWORD=
ES_CLOUD_ID=
ES_API_ID=
ES_API_KEY=
ES_SSL_CERT=
```

For multiple nodes, pass in as comma separated:

```dotenv
ES_HOSTS="http://es01:9200,http://es02:9200,http://es03:9200"
```

Add the `elasticsearch` connection in `config/database.php`

```php
'connections' => [
    'elasticsearch' => [
            'driver'       => 'elasticsearch',
            'auth_type'    => env('ES_AUTH_TYPE', 'http'), //http, cloud or api
            'hosts'        => explode(',', env('ES_HOSTS', 'http://localhost:9200')),
            'username'     => env('ES_USERNAME', ''),
            'password'     => env('ES_PASSWORD', ''),
            'cloud_id'     => env('ES_CLOUD_ID', ''),
            'api_id'       => env('ES_API_ID', ''),
            'api_key'      => env('ES_API_KEY', ''),
            'ssl_cert'     => env('ES_SSL_CERT', ''),
            'index_prefix' => false, //prefix all Laravel administered indices
            'query_log'    => [
                'index'      => 'laravel_query_logs', //Or false to disable query logging
                'error_only' => true, //If false, the all queries are logged
            ],
        ],
    .....

```

Add the service provider to `config/app.php` (If your Laravel version does not autoload packages)

```php
'providers' => [
    ...
    ...
    PDPhilip\Elasticsearch\ElasticServiceProvider::class,
    ...

```

Eloquent
===============

### Extending the base model

Define your Eloquent models by extending the `PDPhilip\Elasticsearch\Eloquent\Model` class;

```php
use PDPhilip\Elasticsearch\Eloquent\Model;
/**
 * @mixin \Eloquent
 */
class Product extends Model
{
    protected $connection = 'elasticsearch';
}
```

In this example, the corresponding index for `Product` is `products`. In most cases, the `elasticsearch` connection
won't be the default connection. In that case you'll need to include `protected $connection = 'elasticsearch'` in your
model.

To change the inferred index name, pass the `$index` property:

```php
use PDPhilip\Elasticsearch\Eloquent\Model;
/**
 * @mixin \Eloquent
 */
class Product extends Model
{
    protected $index = 'my_products';	    
}
```

Querying Models
-------------

#### ALL

Retrieving all records for a model

```php
$products = Product::all();
```

#### Find

Retrieving a record by primary key** (_id)

```php
$product = Product::find('IiLKG38BCOXW3U9a4zcn');
$product = Product::findOrFail('IiLKG38BCOXW3U9a4zcn');
```

#### First

```php
$product = Product::where('status',1)->first();
```

#### Where

```php
$products = Product::where('status',1)->take(10)->get();
$products = Product::where('manufacturer.country', 'England')->take(10)->get();
$products = Product::where('status','>=', 3)->take(10)->get();  
$products = Product::where('color','!=', 'red')->take(10)->get(); //*See notes
```

*Note: this query will also include collections where the color field does not exist, to exclude these,
use [whereNotNull()](#whereNotNull)

#### Where LIKE

```php
$products = Product::where('color', 'like', 'bl')->orderBy('color.keyword')->get();
// Will find blue and black
// No need to use SQL LIKE %bl%
// Text field is used for searching, keyword is used for ordering
```

#### OR Statements

```php
$products = Product::where('is_active', true)->orWhere('in_stock', '>=', 50)->get();
```

#### Chaining OR/AND statements

```php
$products = Product::where('type', 'coffee')
                ->where('is_approved', true)
                ->orWhere('type', 'tea')
                ->where('is_approved', true)
                ->get(); //Returns approved coffee or approved tea
```

Note: **Order of chaining matters** , It reads naturally from left to write having `where() as AND where `
& `orWhere() as OR where `. In the above example, the query would be:

`"((name:"coffee") AND (is_approved:"1")) OR ((name:"tea") AND (is_approved:"1"))"`

#### WhereIn

```php
$products = Product::whereIn('status', [1,5,11])->get();
```

#### WhereNotIn

```php
$products = Product::whereNotIn('color', ['red','green'])->get();
```

#### WhereNotNull

> Can be read as Where {field} Exists

When using `whereNotIn` objects will be returned if the field is non-existent. Combine with `whereNotNull('status')` to
leave out those documents. Ex:

```php
$products = Product::whereNotIn('color', ['red','green'])->whereNotNull('color')->get();
```

#### WhereNull

> Can be read as Where {field} does not exist

```php
$products = Product::whereNull('color')->get(); //Return all collections that doesn't have a 'color' field
```

#### WhereBetween

```php
$products = Product::whereBetween('in_stock', [10, 100])->get();
$products = Product::whereBetween('orders', [1, 20])->orWhereBetween('orders', [100, 200])->get();
```

### Dates

Elasticsearch by default converts a date into a timestamp, and applies the `strict_date_optional_time||epoch_millis`
format. If you have not changed the format at the index then acceptable values are:

- 2022-01-29
- 2022-01-29T13:05:59
- 2022-01-29T13:05:59+0:00
- 2022-01-29T12:10:30Z
- 1643500799 (timestamp)

With Carbon

```php
Carbon::now()->modify('-1 week')->toIso8601String()
```

You can use these values in a normal [where](#where) clause, or use the built-in date clause, ie:

**WhereDate**

```php
$products = Product::whereDate('created_at', '2022-01-29')->get();
```

**Note:** The usage for `whereMonth` / `whereDay` / `whereYear` / `whereTime` has disabled for the current version of
this plugin

### Aggregation

The usual:

```php
$totalSales = Sale::count();
$highestPrice = Sale::max('price');
$lowestPrice = Sale::min('price');
$averagePricePerSale = Sale::avg('price');
$totalEarnings = Sale::sum('price');
```

Combined with where clauses:

```php
$averagePrice = Product::whereNotIn('color', ['red','green'])->avg('price');
```

Elasticsearch [Matrix](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-aggregations-matrix-stats-aggregation.html)

```php
$stats = Product::whereNotIn('color', ['red','green'])->matrix('price');
$stats = Product::whereNotIn('color', ['red', 'green'])->matrix(['price', 'orders']);
```
Matrix results return as (example):
```json
{
    "matrix": {
        "doc_count": 24,
        "fields": [
            {
                "name": "price",
                "count": 24,
                "mean": 944.1987476348877,

                    "orders": 5569.635773119718
                },
                "correlation": {
                    "price": 1,
                    "orders": 0.03421141805225852
                }
            },
            {
                "name": "orders",
                "count": 24,
                "mean": 501.79166666666663,

                    "orders": 67454.5199275362
                },
                "correlation": {
                    "price": 0.03421141805225852,
                    "orders": 1
                }
            }
        ]
    }
}

```

### Ordering

When searching text fields Elasticsearch uses an internal scoring to rank and sort by the most relevant results as a
default return ordering. You can override this by ordering by and fields you like (**except for Text fields**,
see: [Ordering by Text field](#ordering-by-text-field) )

#### OrderBy

```php
$products = Product::orderBy('status')->get();
$products = Product::orderBy('created_at','desc')->get();
```

#### OrderByDesc

```php
$products = Product::orderByDesc('created_at')->get();
```

#### Offset & Limit (skip & take)

```php
$products = Product::skip(10)->take(5)->get();
```

#### Pagination

```php
$products = Product::where('is_active',true)
$products = $products->paginate(50)  
```

Pagination links (Blade)

```php+HTML
{{ $products->appends(request()->query())->links() }}
```



Elasticsearch specific queries
-----------------------------

#### Geo:

**GeoBox**

Filters results of all geo points that fall within a box drawn from `topleft[lat,lon]` to `bottomRight[lat,lon]`

- **Method**: `filterGeoBox($field,$topleft,$bottomRight)`
- `$topleft` and `$bottomRight`  are arrays that hold [$lat,$lon] coordinates

```php
UserLog::where('status',7)->filterGeoBox('agent.geo',[-10,10],[10,-10])->get();
```

**GeoPoint**

Filters results that fall within a radius distance from a `point[lat,lon]`

- **Method**: `filterGeoPoint($field,$distance,$point)`
- `$distance` is a string value of distance and distance-unit, see [https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/api-conventions.html#distance-units](distance units)

```php
UserLog::where('status',7)->filterGeoPoint('agent.geo','20km',[0,0])->get();
```

**Note:** the field **must be of type geo otherwise your [shards will fail](#error-all-shards-failed) **, make sure to set the geo field in your [migration](#migrations), ex:

```php
Schema::create('user_logs',function (IndexBlueprint $index){
	$index->geo('agent.geo');
});
```



#### Regex (in where)

[Syntax](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/regexp-syntax.html)

```php
Product::whereRegex('color','bl(ue)?(ack)?')->get();   //Returns blue or black
Product::whereRegex('color','bl...*')->get();           //Returns blue or black or blond or blush etc..
```



Saving Models
-------------

The same as you always have with Laravel:

#### Save

[Option A] Attribute assigning:

```php
$log = new UserLog;
$log->user_id = $userId;
$log->title = $title;
$log->status = 1;
$log->save();
```

#### Create

[Option B] via `create()`

```php
$log = UserLog::create([
    'user_id' => $userId,
    'title'   => $title,
    'status'  => 1,
]);
```

> Keep in mind, the `$fillable` and `$guarded` attributes are honored when using `create()` or `update()`

#### Update

Same goes for updating

```php
$log = UserLog::where('status',1)->first();
$log->status = 2;
$log->save();
```

### Mass updating

```php
$updates = Product::where('status', 1)->update(['status' => 4]); //Updates all statuses from 1 to 4
// $updates => int (number of affected collections)
```

#### Fast Saves

**Saving 'without refresh'**

Elasticsearch will write a new document and return the `_id` before it has been indexed. This means that there could be
a delay in looking up the document that has just been created. To keep the indexed data consistent, the default is to *
write a new document and wait until it has been indexed* - If you know that you won't need to look up or manipulate the
new document immediately, then you can leverage the speed benefit of `write and move on` with `saveWithoutRefresh()`
and `createWithoutRefresh()`

```php
$log->saveWithoutRefresh();
//and
UserLog::createWithoutRefresh($attributes);
```

Example with undesired outcome:

```php
//BAD, AVOID:
$log = new UserLog;
$log->user_id = $userId;
$log->title = $title;
$log->status = 1;
$log->saveWithoutRefresh();
$log->company_id = 'ABC-123'
$log->saveWithoutRefresh();
//Will result in two separate records
```

### Deleting

#### Delete

The same as you always have with Laravel:

```php
$product = Product::find('IiLKG38BCOXW3U9a4zcn');
$product->delete();
//Or by mass
$product = Product::whereNull('color')->delete(); //Delete all records that doesn't have a color field

```

#### Truncate

Removes all records in index, *but keeps the index*, to remove index completely
use [Schema: Index Delete](#index-delete)

```php
Product::truncate(); 
```

#### Destroy by ID

```php
Product::destroy('9iKKHH8BCOXW3U9ag1_4'); //as single _id 
Product::destroy('4yKKHH8BCOXW3U9ag1-8', '_iKKHH8BCOXW3U9ahF8Q'); //as multiple _ids
Product::destroy(['7CKKHH8BCOXW3U9ag1_a', '7iKKHH8BCOXW3U9ag1_h']); //as array of _ids
```

### Soft Deletes

When soft deleting a model, it is not actually removed from the index. Instead, a deleted_at timestamp is set on the
record and is excluded from any queries unless explicitly called on.

```php
use PDPhilip\Elasticsearch\Eloquent\Model;
use PDPhilip\Elasticsearch\Eloquent\SoftDeletes;

class Product extends Model
{
    use SoftDeletes;
		
}
```

Example:

```php
//With soft delete enabled
Product::destroy('wCIfHX8BCOXW3U9ahWH9');
Product::withTrashed()->where('_id', 'wCIfHX8BCOXW3U9ahWH9')->get();
Product::withTrashed()->where('_id', 'wCIfHX8BCOXW3U9ahWH9')->restore(); //restore by query

//Force delete
$product = Product::find('wCIfHX8BCOXW3U9ahWH9');
$product->forceDelete();

```



Elasticsearching
===============

The Search Query
----------------

The search query is different from the `where()->get()` methods as search is performed over all (or selected) fields in the index. Building a search query is easy and intuitive to seasoned Eloquenters with a slight twist; simply static call off your model with `term()`, chain your ORM clauses, then end your chain with `search()` to perform your search, ie:

```php
MyModel::term('XYZ')->.........->search()
```

### 1.Term:

**1.1 Simple example**

- To search across all the fields in the **books** index for '**eric**' (case-insensitive if the default analyser is set), 
- Results ordered by most relevant first (score in desc order) 

```php
Book::term('Eric')->search();
```

**1.2 Multiple terms**

- To search across all the fields in the **books** index for: **eric OR (lean AND startup)**
- ***Note**: You can't start a search query chain with and/or and you can't have subsequent chained terms without and/or - **ordering matters***

```php
Book::term('Eric')->orTerm('Lean')->andTerm('Startup')->search();
```

**1.3 Boosting Terms**

- **Boosting terms: `term(string $term, int $boostFactor)`**
- To search across all fields for **eric OR lean OR startup** but 'eric' is boosted by a factor of 2; **(eric)^2**
- Boosting affects the score and thus the ordering of the results for relevance
- Also note, spaces in terms are treated as OR's between each word

```php
Book::term('Eric',2)->orTerm('Lean Startup')->search();
```

**1.4 Searching over selected fields**

- To search across fields [**title, author and description**] for **eric**.

```php
Book::term('Eric')->fields(['title','author','description'])->search();
```

**1.5 Boosting fields**

- To search across fields [**title, author and description**] for **eric**.
- **title** is boosted by a factor of 3, search hits here will be the most relevant
- **author** is boosted by a factor of 2, search hits here will be the second most relevant
- **description** has no boost, search hits here will be the least relevant
- *The results, as per the default, are ordered by most relevant first (score in desc order)* 

```php
Book::term('Eric')->field('title',3)->field('author',2)->field('description')->search();
```

**1.6 Minimum should match**

- Controls how many 'should' clauses the query should match
- Caveats:
  - Fields must be specified in your query
  - You can have no standard clauses in your query (ex `where()`)
  - Won't work on SoftDelete enabled models
- https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-minimum-should-match.html

- Match at least 2 of the 3 terms:

```php
Book::term('Eric')->orTerm('Lean')->orTerm('Startup')->field('title')->field('author')->minShouldMatch(2)->search();
```

**1.7 Min Score**

- Sets a min_score filter for the search
- (Optional, float) Minimum 'relevance score' for matching documents. Documents with a lower 'score' are not included in the search results.

```php
Book::term('Eric')->field('title',3)->field('author',2)->field('description')->minScore(2.1)->search();
```

**1.8 Blend Search with [most] standard eloquent queries** 

- Search for 'david' where field `is_active` is `true`:

```php
Book::term('David')->field('title',3)->field('author',2)->field('description')->minScore(2.1)->where('is_active',true)->search();
```



### 2. FuzzyTerm:

- Same usage as `term()` `andTerm()` `orTerm()` but as 
  - `fuzzyTerm()`
  - `orFuzzyTerm()`
  - `andFuzzyTerm()`

```php
Book::fuzzyTerm('quikc')->orFuzzyTerm('brwn')->andFuzzyTerm('foks')->search();
```

### 2. RegEx in Search:

https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/regexp-syntax.html

- Same usage as `term()` `andTerm()` `orTerm()` but as 
  - `regEx()`
  - `orRegEx()`
  - `andRegEx()`

```php
Book::regEx('joh?n(ath[oa]n)')->andRegEx('doey*')->search();
```



Mutators & Casting
-------------

All Laravel's Mutating and casting features are inherited:

See [https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/eloquent-mutators](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/eloquent-mutators)

Cool!

Relationships
==============

Model Relationships are the lifeblood of any Laravel App, for that you can use them with `belongsTo` , `hasMany`
, `hasOne`, `morphOne` and `morphMany` as you have before:

#### Elasticsearch <-> Elasticsearch

Full Example:

Company:

```php
/**
 * App\Models\Company
 *
 ******Fields*******
 * @property string $_id
 * @property string $name
 * @property integer $status
 * @property \Illuminate\Support\Carbon|null $created_at

 * @property-read CompanyLog $companyLogs
 * @property-read CompanyProfile $companyProfile
 * @property-read Avatar $avatar
 * @property-read Photos $photos
 *
 * @mixin \Eloquent
 *
 */
class Company extends Model
{
    protected $connection = 'elasticsearch';
  
    //Relationships  =====================================

    public function companyLogs()
    {
        return $this->hasMany(CompanyLog::class);
    }

    public function companyProfile()
    {
        return $this->hasOne(CompanyProfile::class);
    }

    public function avatar()
    {
        return $this->morphOne(Avatar::class, 'imageable');
    }

    public function photos()
    {
        return $this->morphMany(Photo::class, 'photoable');
    }
}

```

CompanyLog:

```php

    }
}
```

Example Usage:

```php
$company = Company::first();
$company->companyLogs->toArray(); //Shows all company logs (has many)
$company->companyProfile->toArray(); //Shows the company profile (has one)
$company->avatar->toArray(); //Shows the company avatar (morph one)
$company->photos->toArray(); //Shows the company photos (morph many)

```

#### Elasticsearch <-> MySQL

Since it's unlikely that you will use Elasticsearch exclusively in your App; we've ensured that you can have hybrid
relationships between Elasticsearch and MySQL (Or any native Laravel datasource) models.

**For the MySQL(or similar) model that you wish to bind to Elasticsearch relationships, please
use**: `use PDPhilip\Elasticsearch\Eloquent\HybridRelations`

Example, mysql User model:

```php
use Illuminate\Foundation\Auth\User as Authenticatable;
use PDPhilip\Elasticsearch\Eloquent\HybridRelations;

/**
 * App\Models\User
 *
 * *****Relationships*******
 * @property-read User $user
 */
class User extends Authenticatable
{
  use HybridRelations;
  
  protected $connection = 'mysql'; 

  //Relationships  =====================================
  // With Elasticsearch models
  
  public function userLogs()
  {
    return $this->hasMany(UserLog::class);
  }
  
  public function userProfile()
  {
    return $this->hasOne(UserProfile::class);
  }
  
  public function company()
  {
    return $this->belongsTo(Company::class);
  }
 
  public function avatar()
  {
		return $this->morphOne(Avatar::class, 'imageable');
  }

  public function photos()
  {
		return $this->morphMany(Photo::class, 'photoable');
	}
}
```

UserLog

```php
/**
 * App\Models\UserLog
 ******Fields*******
 * @property string $_id
 * @property string $company_id
 * @property string $title
 * @property integer $code
 * @property mixed $meta
 * @property Carbon|null $created_at
 * @property Carbon|null $updated_at
 ******Relationships*******
 * @property-read User $user
 *
 * @mixin \Eloquent
 */
class UserLog extends Model
{

    protected $connection = 'elasticsearch';

    public function user()
    {
        return $this->belongsTo(User::class);
    }

}
```

UserProfile

```php
/**
 * App\Models\UserProfile
 *
 ******Fields*******
 *
 * @property string $_id
 * @property string $user_id
 * @property string $twitter
 * @property string $facebook
 * @property string $address
 * @property \Illuminate\Support\Carbon|null $created_at
 * @property \Illuminate\Support\Carbon|null $updated_at
 *
 ******Relationships*******
 * @property-read User $user
 *
 ******Attributes*******
 * @property-read mixed $status_name
 * @property-read mixed $status_color
 *
 * @mixin \Eloquent
 *
 */
class UserProfile extends Model
{

    protected $connection = 'elasticsearch';
    
    //Relationships  =====================================

    public function user()
    {
        return $this->belongsTo(User::class);
    }
    
}
```

- Company (as example before) where user has the filed `company_id` as $company->_id
- Avatar: (as before) having `imageable_id` as $user->id and `imageable_type` as 'App\Models\User'
- Photo: (as before) having `photoable_id` as $user->id and `photoable_type` as 'App\Models\User'

Example usage:

```php
$user = User::first();
$user->company->name; //Company name for the user
$user->userProfile->twitter;
$user->avatar->url; //Link to Avatar
$user->photos->toArray(); //Array of photos

$userLog = UserLog::first();
$userLog->user->name; 
```

Schema/Index
==========
Migrations
----------

Since there is very little overlap with how Elasticsearch handles index management to how MySQL and related technologies
handle Schema manipulation; the schema feature of this plugin has been written from the ground up to work 100% with
Elasticsearch.

You can still create a migration class as normal (and it's recommended that you do), however the `up()` and `down()`
methods will need to encapsulate the following:

- **Schema** via `PDPhilip\Elasticsearch\Schema\Schema`
- **IndexBlueprint** via `PDPhilip\Elasticsearch\Schema\IndexBlueprint`
- **AnalyzerBlueprint** via `PDPhilip\Elasticsearch\Schema\AnalyzerBlueprint`

Full example:

```php
<?php

use Illuminate\Database\Migrations\Migration;
use PDPhilip\Elasticsearch\Schema\Schema;
use PDPhilip\Elasticsearch\Schema\IndexBlueprint;
use PDPhilip\Elasticsearch\Schema\AnalyzerBlueprint;

class MyIndexes extends Migration
{
    public function up()
    {
        Schema::create('contacts', function (IndexBlueprint $index) {
          //first_name & last_name is automatically added to this field, 
          //you can search by full_name without ever writing to full_name  
          $index->text('first_name')->copyTo('full_name');
          $index->text('last_name')->copyTo('full_name');
          $index->text('full_name');

          //Multiple types => Order matters ::
          //Top level `email` will be a searchable text field
          //Sub Property will be a keyword type which can be sorted using orderBy('email.keyword')            
          $index->text('email');
          $index->keyword('email');

          //Dates have an optional formatting as second parameter
          $index->date('first_contact', 'epoch_second');
            
          //Objects are defined with dot notation:
          $index->text('products.name');
          $index->float('products.price')->coerce(false);

          //Disk space considerations ::
          //Not indexed and not searchable:
          $index->text('internal_notes')->docValues(false);  
          //Remove scoring for search:
          $index->array('tags')->norms(false);  
          //Remove from index, can't search by this field but can still use for aggregations:
          $index->integer('score')->index(false);  

          //If null is passed as value, then it will be saved as 'NA' which is searchable
          $index->keyword('favorite_color')->nullValue('NA');  

          //Alias Example
          $index->text('notes');
          $index->alias('comments', 'notes');

          $index->geo('last_login');
          $index->date('created_at');
          $index->date('updated_at');

          //Settings
          $index->settings('number_of_shards', 3);
          $index->settings('number_of_replicas', 2);

          //Other Mappings
          $index->map('dynamic', false);
          $index->map('date_detection', false);
        });
        
        //Example analyzer builder
        Schema::setAnalyser('contacts', function (AnalyzerBlueprint $settings) {
            $settings->analyzer('my_custom_analyzer')
                ->type('custom')
                ->tokenizer('punctuation')
                ->filter(['lowercase', 'english_stop'])
                ->charFilter(['emoticons']);
            $settings->tokenizer('punctuation')
                ->type('pattern')
                ->pattern('[ .,!?]');
            $settings->charFilter('emoticons')
                ->type('mapping')
                ->mappings([":) => _happy_", ":( => _sad_"]);
            $settings->filter('english_stop')
                ->type('stop')
                ->stopwords('_english_');
        });
    }
    
    public function down()
    {
        Schema::deleteIfExists('contacts');
    }
}

```

All methods

```php
Schema::getIndices();
Schema::getMappings('my_index')
Schema::getSettings('my_index')
Schema::create('my_index',function (IndexBlueprint $index) {
    //......
})
Schema::createIfNotExists('my_index',function (IndexBlueprint $index) {
    //......
})
Schema::reIndex('from_index','to_index') {
    //......
})
Schema::modify('my_index',function (IndexBlueprint $index) {
    //......
});
Schema::delete('my_index')
Schema::deleteIfExists('my_index')
Schema::setAnalyser('my_index',function (AnalyzerBlueprint $settings) {
	//......
});
//Booleans
Schema::hasField('my_index','my_field')
Schema::hasFields('my_index',['field_a','field_b','field_c'])
Schema::hasIndex('my_index')
//DIY
Schema::dsl('indexMethod',$dslParams)

```

Example manual DSL:

```php
Schema::dsl('close',['index' => 'my_index'])
$dslParams = [
  'index' => 'my_index',
  'body' => .........
];
Schema::dsl('putSettings',$dslParams)
Schema::dsl('open',['index' => 'my_index'])
```

Behind the scenes it uses the official elasticsearch PHP client, it will call `$client->indices()->{$method}($params);`


Queues
----------
_[Coming]_


Dynamic Indies
========
In some cases you will need to split a model into different indices. There are limits to this to keep within reasonable Laravel ORM bounds, but if you keep the index prefix consistent then the plugin can manage the rest. 

For example, let's imagine we're tracking page hits, the `PageHit.php` model could be

```php
<?php

namespace App\Models;

use PDPhilip\Elasticsearch\Eloquent\Model as Eloquent;

class PageHit extends Eloquent
{
    protected $connection = 'elasticsearch';
    protected $index = 'page_hits_*'; //Dynamic index

}
```

If you set a dynamic index you can read/search across all the indices that match the prefix `page_hits_`

```php 
$pageHits = PageHit::where('page_id',1)->get();
```

You will need to set the record's actual index when creating a new record, with `setIndex('value')` 

Create example:
```php
$pageHit = new PageHit
$pageHit->page_id = 4;
$pageHit->ip = $someIp;
$pageHit->setIndex('page_hits_'.date('Y-m-d'));
$pageHit->save(); 

```

Each eloquent model will have the current record's index embedded into it, to retrieve it simply call `getRecordIndex()`
```php
$pageHit->getRecordIndex();  //returns page_hits_2021-01-01
```


```

RAW DSL
========

BYO query, sure! We'll get out the way and try to return the values in a collection for you:

Searching Models:

```php
$bodyParams = [
  'query' => [
    'match' => [
      'color' => 'silver',
    ],
  ],
];

return Product::rawSearch($bodyParams); //Will search within the products index
```

Elasticsearchisms
=================

#### Error: all shards failed

This error usually points to an index mapping issue, ex:

- Trying to order on a TEXT field
- Trying a get filter on a field that is not explicitly set as one

#### Elasticsearch's default search limit is to return 10 collections

This plugin sets the default limit to 1000, however you can set your own with `MAX_SIZE`:

```php
use PDPhilip\Elasticsearch\Eloquent\Model;
/**
 * @mixin \Eloquent
 */
class Product extends Model
{
    const MAX_SIZE = 10000;
    protected $connection = 'elasticsearch';
}

```

**Remember, you can use chunking if you need to cycle through all the records**

#### Empty Text Fields

By default, empty text fields are not searchable as they are not indexed. If you need to be able to search for empty
values you have two options:

1. Exclude the field on Saving/Updating , then use [#wherenull](#wherenull)
2. Create an index where the field is set to have a null value see [Schema](#Schema/index)
   where `$index->keyword('favorite_color')->nullValue('NA');  `

#### Ordering by Text field

Elasticsearch can not order by text fields due to how the values are indexed and tokenized. If you do not define a
string value upfront in your [Schema](#Schema/index) then Elasticsearch will default to saving the field as a `text`
field. If you try to sort by that field the database engine will fail. Options:

1. If you do not need to search the text within the field and ordering is important, then use a `keyword` field type: To
   do so define your index upfront in the  [Schema](#Schema/index) and set `$index->keyword('email')`

2. If you need to have the field both searchable and sortable, then you'll need to have a multi type definition upfront
   in your [Schema](#Schema/index) , ex:

   ```php
   $index->text('description')
   $index->keyword('description')
   ```

   The order matters, the field will primarily be a text field, required for searching with a keyword sub-type. To be
   able to order by this field you would have to use `orderBy('description.keyword')` to tell elasticsearch which type
   to use.

#### Saving and refresh

Refresh requests are synchronous and do not return a response until the refresh operation completes.

All saves are by default done with `refresh=wait_for` parameter - this is to ensure that the data is available
immediately after it has been written. However, there is response delay which may not be optimal. If you intend to write
once and not update immediately or won't need to search for the record immediately, then do `saveWithoutRefresh()`

### Unsupported Eloquent methods

`upsert()`, `distinct()`, `groupBy()`, `groupByRaw()`
